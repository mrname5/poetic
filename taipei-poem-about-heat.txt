Poem 1

In Taipei's clasp, summer unfolds,
A stifling embrace, as the tale is told.
Amidst sweltering streets and weary hearts,
The sun scorches fiercely, its burning darts.

The city awakens, drained and wilted,
Drenched in sweat, its spirit stilted.
A stagnant air suffocates, no respite,
Sapping energy, causing endless plight.

In Xinyi District, skyscrapers loom,
Trapping heat, casting a suffocating gloom.
Taipei 101 stands tall, imposing and stern,
A symbol of heat, from which we yearn.

The night markets suffocate, neon lights glare,
Sweat-soaked crowds shuffle with a heavy air.
Stifling scents of sizzling street food,
Amidst humidity, no solace, no mood.

Yangmingshan beckons, mountains harsh and dry,
Escape to nature, where shadows lie.
Hot springs offer no relief, boiling and cruel,
Adding to the discomfort, a relentless duel.

The rivers crawl lazily, sluggish and warm,
Reflecting the heat, their essence transformed.
As people seek respite from the blazing sun,
In parks and shelters, the struggle is won.

Taipei's summer burden, an oppressive display,
Where cultures wilt and dreams fade away.
With suffocating heat, it drives us apart,
A season of discomfort, etched in the heart.

But amidst Taipei's scorching plight, we endure,
Seeking respite from morning till night for sure.
In the city's grasp, we find strength in our stride,
Embracing the heat, our spirits won't subside.

For within this arduous burden, we persist,
Knowing that summer's trials won't resist.
Taipei's essence, beyond the discomfort it imparts,
Resides a resilience, etched deep in our hearts.
